# Contributing to PaySuper

Thank you for your interest in contributing to PaySuper! We welcome everybody who wants to contribute healthily and constructively. To help us create a safe and positive community experience for all, we require all participants to adhere to [PaySuper Code of Conduct](https://github.com/paysuper/code-of-conduct/blob/master/README.md).

## Become a contributor

You can contribute to PaySuper in several ways. Here are some examples:

- Report bugs.
- Contribute to the codebase.
- Write technical documentation and blog posts, for users and contributors.
- Help others by answering questions.

Contributing to open source can be a rewarding way to learn, teach, and build experience in just about any skill you can imagine. [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) is a great one to get you inspired.

### Report bugs

Report bugs and issues by submitting a [bug report](../../issues/new?labels=type%3A+bug&template=1-bug_report.md). Make sure that you provide as much information as possible on how to reproduce the bug.

Within the context of PaySuper documentation, which this repository represents, a missing example or an unclear manual is considered a bug. Please tell us where the docs are not good enough so we make them better. Or feel free to propose a fix yourself.

### Feature Requests and support

If you have an idea of how to improve PaySuper documentation (or anything related, really) or have general feedback, you're welcome to submit a [feature request](../../issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=).

### Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

At this very moment, we're working on the CLA. Until it is ready we may be on the slower side in accepting your contributions.
