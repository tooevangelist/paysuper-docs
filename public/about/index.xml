      <description>Integration Integrating payment acceptance through Pay One into your website is really easy. To install the widget on the page you only have to insert a single line of code. Integration tests are automated. KYC procedure and signing of a standard-form contract on payment acceptance occur within a few days. Electronic signature can be used.
Operation speed We believe that fast loading of the payment form is one of the most important factors for a good paying conversion.</description>

      <description>We do not identify them based solely on IP. We recognize a USA user who came to Germany and opened the payment interface there, so as not to make the mistake of showing them the form in German and with German payment methods.
Most of the project settings can be configured separately for each region or language:

      <title>Retention of Users with Unfinished Transactions</title>

      <description>When Pay One has enough data to communicate with the user and it is not prohibited by local laws, the user is prompted to finish the transaction: via email, a push-notification or instant messenger.
If integrated with Uttu, you can also set up a channel for delivering such notifications through banners or other ad placements.
 This approach allows you to return about 5% of users who have not completed the payment.</description>

      <description>A return of funds can be initiated not only by you (refund), but also on the side of the payment method, for example, at the user’s request to the card-issuing bank (chargeback).
The rules for handling such situations differ depending on the payment method and territory.
 In all cases, Pay One consistently notifies you via the API and in your account.
 As a rule, you have about 30 days to dispute a chargeback on a specific transaction by providing proof that the buyer has received the product.</description>

      <description>Anyone can use the PaySuper toolkit to create their own payment solution.
This will require you to:
 Download and deploy the necessary PaySuper elements in your infrastructure. Sign a contract for accepting payments with a bank (or banks). Pass PCI DSS certification.  Open source allows us to implement best practices developed by the community in our SaaS-solution in the shortest possible time. The best versions of customized forms, which take into account the specifics of use and legislation in different regions, are constantly added to the Pay One payment form template library.</description>
