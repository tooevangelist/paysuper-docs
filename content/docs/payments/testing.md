# Testing the Payment Process
***

The Payment Form integration should be tested in the Sandbox before [going live](/docs/payments/live/).

The Sandbox provides full functionality but it only emulates processing, no actual bank transactions are made.

When using PaySuper JS SDK ensure that:

* [Handlers for the events](/docs/payments/sdk-integration/#step-4-handle-the-purchase-events) are displayed properly.
* The PaySuper object is created with all [required parameters](/docs/payments/sdk-integration/#step-2-provide-parameters) or [token](/docs/payments/token/).

In case of using the PaySuper API in your server-side code ensure that:

* All [API errors](/docs/api/#section/Errors) are handled accurately.
* [Webhooks](/docs/payments/webhooks/) contains properly URL configured in the Functional URL section on the Project webhooks page.

## Test card numbers 

To test a bank card payment in the Sandbox enter arbitrary expiry date (the format is MM/YY), a Secure code (CVC/CVV, the format is 3 digits) and a cardholder name (the format is first name last name).

{{< hint warning >}}
You can also specify incorrect details (card number, expiration date, or CVV) to generate an error.
{{< /hint >}}

You will be redirected to the Sandbox page to select the desired results the success or failure. After you click the result button the current page will be closed and you will be redirected to the Checkout Form to view the purchase status.

> Note, that when Merchant chooses to fail authentication, payment is always declined, no matter what PAN has been used.

Use any of the following test card numbers:

> Note that `Authorized` cards must be used only to test antifraud system reaction with compulsory transfer payment to preauthorization.

### 3-D Secure test cards

3-D Secure is emulated with a page that doesn’t require any password but only shows 2 buttons. One button is for successful authentication, another is for failed authentication.
