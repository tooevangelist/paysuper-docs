To get started with PaySuper, choose your business model:

### Simple Checkout

Simple Checkout is designed for payment orders with dynamical pricing, for example, stores that use its e-commerce engine for product management. Likewise, this option works well with non-product payments such as donations. In this mode, you specify the currency and the price, while the payment amount due for the end-user is calculated accordingly to the exchange rate if it differs from the specified order currency.

### Products Checkout

PaySuper Checkout provides several types of products which you specify in an order as a parameter `type`:

**Game Keys**

**Virtual Items**

This sales option enables you to sell your Virtual Items, like swords, guns, helmets and virtual currency packs.

**Virtual Currency**
